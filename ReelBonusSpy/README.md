In (vanilla) WEBFISHING, you gain a 1.1x multiplier to your catch chance if you've reeled in the last 0.25 seconds.

This mod notifies you when this multiplier would have affected a catch, either if you did catch a fish as a result of having the bonus, or missed a catch as a result of not having the bonus.
